# 💳 Ambient Expense Agent

> An AI-powered corporate expense approval system built with **Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) 2.0** using the **Graph Workflow API**. The agent automatically validates, categorizes, reviews, and approves employee expense reports while integrating AI-assisted decision making with deterministic workflow execution and human-in-the-loop approvals.

# 📖 Overview

Corporate expense approvals often require balancing automation, policy compliance, and security. Traditional rule-based systems become difficult to maintain as business policies evolve.

Ambient Expense Agent demonstrates how **Google ADK 2.0 Graph Workflows** can orchestrate AI-assisted business processes while maintaining deterministic execution and enterprise-grade approval controls.

The workflow automatically approves low-risk expenses while routing higher-value submissions through security validation, AI-assisted risk review, and human approval before final booking.

# 🔄 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Ingest Expense

Receives an employee expense report and performs initial validation.

---

### 2️⃣ Threshold Check

Determines whether the submitted amount exceeds the automatic approval threshold.

- **Less than $100**
  - Automatically approved.

- **Greater than or equal to $100**
  - Sent for additional validation.

---

### 3️⃣ Security Checkpoint

Performs security and policy validation before AI review.

Possible outcomes:

- Clean
- Security Alert

---

### 4️⃣ Risk Reviewer

Uses AI reasoning to analyze higher-value expenses.

Evaluates:

- Spending patterns
- Policy compliance
- Potential anomalies
- Business justification

---

### 5️⃣ Human Approval

High-risk or security-sensitive expenses require manual approval.

Decision:

- ✅ Approved
- ❌ Rejected

---

### 6️⃣ Final Processing

Approved expenses:

```
Book Expense
```

Rejected expenses:

```
Reject Expense
```
